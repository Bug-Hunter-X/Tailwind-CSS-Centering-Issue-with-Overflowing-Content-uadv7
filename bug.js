```javascript
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p>This is some text.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a centered div with a red background. However, if the content within the inner div overflows, it might break the centering.
